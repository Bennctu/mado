	* twin.h:
	* twinint.h:
	Add a few definitions

	* twin_convolve.c: (_twin_path_leftpoint), (twin_path_convolve):
	Find pen starting point as closest to the normal to the path.
	Restructure convolve loop to be easier to understand
	
	* twin_path.c: (twin_path_circle):
	Round circle coordinates instead of truncating them
	
	* twin_poly.c: (_twin_fixed_grid_ceil), (_twin_edge_build),
	(_span_fill), (_twin_edge_fill):
	Move sample grid by 1/2 sample step.
	Clip polygons to mask pixmap.
	Modest performance improvement in span filling.
	Fix end case to remove edges before stepping.
	
	* xtwin.c: (main):
	Stroke a path.

	* Makefile.am:
	* twin.h:
	* twin_convolve.c: (_twin_path_leftmost), (_twin_path_step),
	(_clockwise), (twin_path_convolve):

	* twin_geom.c: (_twin_distance_to_point_squared),
	(_twin_distance_to_line_squared):
	* twin_spline.c: (_twin_spline_error_squared), (twin_path_curve):

	(twin_path_fill):
	Add twin_path_circle to generate pens.
	Fix path edge generator to handle last subpath right.

	* twin_poly.c: (_twin_edge_build):
	Skip vertices which don't span a sample row
	
	* xtwin.c: (main):
	test convolutions
