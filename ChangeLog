 	* Makefile.am:
	* configure.ac:
	* twin.h:
	Fix twin_fixed_floor to work for negative values correctly
	Add twin_path_cur_point
	
	* twin_convolve.c: (_twin_path_step), (_around_order), (_angle),
	(_twin_subpath_convolve), (twin_path_convolve):
	fix twin_path_step to actually handle duplicate points.
	Change 'clockwise' to 'around_order' so that all three possible
	results are returned (clockwise, parallel and counterclockwise)
	Handle disjoint strokes

	* twin_font.c: (twin_has_glyph), (twin_path_glyph),
	(twin_glyph_width), (twin_path_string), (twin_path_fglyph),
	(twin_path_ucs4), (_twin_utf8_to_ucs4), (twin_path_utf8):
	Add outline and stroke font support (pick one and remove the other)
	
	* twin_glyphs.c:
	Huge array of stroke fonts from Hershey.  Pick appropriate subset
	and remove extra glyphs (there are a lot here)
	
	* twin_path.c: (_twin_cur_subpath_len), (twin_path_cur_point),
	(twin_path_move), (twin_path_draw), (twin_path_close):
	Eliminate repeated move and close, eliminate duplicate draw.
	
	* twin_poly.c: (_twin_edge_build), (_span_fill), (_twin_edge_fill):
	Add support for 1, 4, 16 and 64 samples.  16 appears to be the
	magic sweet spot.
	
	* twin_ttf/Makefile.am:
	* twin_ttf/Vera.ttf:
	* twin_ttf/twin_ttf.c: (pos), (command), (cpos), (ucs4_to_utf8),
	(glyph), (outline_moveto), (outline_lineto), (outline_conicto),
	(outline_cubicto), (ucs_page), (ucs_first_in_page), (sanitize),
	(facename), (convert_font), (main):
	Convert "real" outline fonts to twin built-ins

	* twin_vera.c:
	Converted version of Bitstream Vera Sans Roman

	* twinint.h:
	* xtwin.c: (main):

	* twin.h:
	* twinint.h:
	Add a few definitions

	* twin_convolve.c: (_twin_path_leftpoint), (twin_path_convolve):
	Find pen starting point as closest to the normal to the path.
	Restructure convolve loop to be easier to understand
	
	* twin_path.c: (twin_path_circle):
	Round circle coordinates instead of truncating them
	
	* twin_poly.c: (_twin_fixed_grid_ceil), (_twin_edge_build),
	(_span_fill), (_twin_edge_fill):
	Move sample grid by 1/2 sample step.
	Clip polygons to mask pixmap.
	Modest performance improvement in span filling.
	Fix end case to remove edges before stepping.
	
	* xtwin.c: (main):
	Stroke a path.

	* Makefile.am:
	* twin.h:
	* twin_convolve.c: (_twin_path_leftmost), (_twin_path_step),
	(_clockwise), (twin_path_convolve):
	Add convolution.  Pen starting position needs work.
	
	* twin_geom.c: (_twin_distance_to_point_squared),
	(_twin_distance_to_line_squared):
	* twin_spline.c: (_twin_spline_error_squared), (twin_path_curve):
	* twinint.h:
	Move shared geometric functions to new file
	
	* twin_path.c: (_sin), (_cos), (twin_path_circle),
	(twin_path_fill):
	Add twin_path_circle to generate pens.
	Fix path edge generator to handle last subpath right.

	* twin_poly.c: (_twin_edge_build):
	Skip vertices which don't span a sample row
	
	* xtwin.c: (main):
	test convolutions
