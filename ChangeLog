	* Makefile.am:
	* twin.h:
	* twin_convolve.c: (_twin_path_leftmost), (_twin_path_step),
	(_clockwise), (twin_path_convolve):
	Add convolution.  Pen starting position needs work.
	
	* twin_geom.c: (_twin_distance_to_point_squared),
	(_twin_distance_to_line_squared):
	* twin_spline.c: (_twin_spline_error_squared), (twin_path_curve):
	* twinint.h:
	Move shared geometric functions to new file
	
	* twin_path.c: (_sin), (_cos), (twin_path_circle),
	(twin_path_fill):
	Add twin_path_circle to generate pens.
	Fix path edge generator to handle last subpath right.

	* twin_poly.c: (_twin_edge_build):
	Skip vertices which don't span a sample row
	
	* xtwin.c: (main):
	test convolutions

	* twin_spline.c: (_lerp_half), (_de_casteljau),
	(_distance_squared_to_point), (_distance_squared_to_segment),
	(_twin_spline_error_squared), (_twin_spline_decompose),
	(twin_path_curve):
	Append cubic BÃ©zier splines to paths

	* xtwin.c: (main):
	Test paths
